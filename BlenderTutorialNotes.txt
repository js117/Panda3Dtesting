sudo apt-get install python python-pip 

"On Debian, using the Debian-packaged version of Blender, as far as I can tell, a system python executable is used."
"If this doesn't work, delete the blender/2.78/python directory - which will make Blender use the system python" 








Mouse: PAN: SHIFT + MMB to pan (move) where MMB == middle mouse button
       ZOOM: MMB scrool
	   ROTATE: hold MMB, move mouse! 

a, x, delete ---> delete all 

View, View Persp/Ortho ---> change perspective 

View, Front

shift + s, r ---> cursor to center

add, mesh, cylinder

tab, z ---> edit mode, wireframe

tab ---> go into/out of edit (object) mode

a ---> de-select 	

b ---> box select

select top of e.g. cylinder object and drag cursor arrows if you want to shrink it. Select whole object, then cursor arrows move it. 

z ---> go into/out of wireframe

ctrl+b ---> bevel; careful what you select (use b, box-select, e.g. to grab the top of an object); rolling middle mouse wheel to "round"

(Left toolbar) Shading/ UVs, Shading, Smooth

(Right Panel) Modifiers (wrench-icon), add modifier, edge-split

Add, mesh, cube

s ---> size the object! Be mindful of where the pivot is, in edit vs. object mode
s, {x, y, z} ---> size object in only the x, y, z plane! 

Selecting in edit mode tips:
"In Blender’s Edit mode, the cube changes color, and dots form at each of the cube’s corners. Each dot is a vertex. The line that forms between two vertices is an edge. A face in Blender is a polygon that has been formed by three or more connecting edges."
OR

Edit mode (z), x ---> better menu for selecting what to delete

(With object selected) r,{x,y,z},{0-180} --> rotate object in x,y,z however many degrees! 

(In wireframe) c ---> circle selection (really useful for vertices for example)

(With e.g. vertices selected) e ---> extrude!!! 

shift + alt + RMB ---> select a continuous group of edges + vertices (?)

(With e.g. edges + vertices selected) f ---> create face

(With object selected) h ---> hide object / alt + h ---> unhide

(With object selected) ctrl + r, v, RMB ---> loop cut (?)

(With a vertex/line selected) ctrl + l ---> select linked lines (?)

shift + alt + RMB ---> LOOP SELECT

(With face selected) i ---> inset

(With object selected, in wireframe+edit modes) shift + d ---> duplicate

(With object selected, in wireframe+edit modes) ctrl + n ---> make normals consistent

(With edge loops selected, in edit mode) ctrl + e, Bridge edge loops ---> cool connecting of loops through extrusion

(With object selected) g ---> to move/translate object around with mouse  

Testing Rotation: 
- Object mode
- Select a link of robot arm
- 3D cursor 
- Click left on fixed rotation point (e.g. joint location)
- Press R, move mouse

Joining objects:
- Select both objects
- Ctrl + J
- Remove faces that will be joined: select, press X, delete faces

Parallel Gripper: (36:00 in vid 1)
- add cube
- add modifier to cube: mirror
- select eye-dropper icon, click on stationary part of hand
- choose right axis (e.g. z)

------------------------
--- Part II: Rigging ---
------------------------

Add, Armature, Single Bone

(With bone selected) (Right-hand panel) Man icon, Display, B-Bone (can put on X-Ray too)

(With bone selected; edit mode) Ctrl + Alt + S, change size 

Select the tip of the B-Bone, press E, extrude to next part of armature

(In Object mode) Select bones, press M, move to bottom layer
[Can use layer menu, on bottom, to make layers visible or not]

Aligning bone tip to object: shift + s + 'selection to cursor' (after placing cursor on center of requested object)

Methodology: keep extending bone along links into joints

-----------------------------
--- Part III: Constraints ---
-----------------------------

- Pose Mode ---> Select bone, go to 'Bone Constraints' option on right hand panel (bone)

- Add Bone Constraint ---> Limit Rotation

- Edit Mode ---> go to 'Data' option on right hand panel (little man) ---> Enable axes, names

- 'Constraints' tab on right hand panel ---> select all bones ('a') ---> Ctrl+N, 'Global +Z Axis'

- Pose Mode ---> select bone ---> go back to 'Bone Constraints' tab
	* Convert: world/local space
	* Limit X/Y/Z as appropriate (can even limit your actual axis, put in the numerical angle constraints)
	* For transform (check)
	* Should be able to grab and rotate now
	** With bone selected, press 'r', and you can rotate in the enabled axis (or axes)!
	
- Put everything back in place: select everything 'a', ALT + G, ALT + R

- Making a line of bones straight: select them, S + Z + 0 (zero)

- Use: Add Bone Constraint ---> Limit Location for linear actuation (also add a limit rotation on all axes to not rotate by accident)
	** With bone selected, press 'g' to move (linearly)
	
- Parent to the Armature:
	* Go to Object Mode
	* First, join relevant parts of the model together (e.g. into links) by selecting multiple pieces, hitting CTRL + J
	
	* Go to Pose Mode
	* Select link, shift + LMB to select corresponding bone, CTRL + P, 'Set Parent to Bone' (now they rotate together!!)
	
	* Can re-parent bones done incorrectly in edit mode. On right side, find the bone icon, scroll down to 'Parent:'
	
- CAD MESH TO PARTS:
	* Select a bunch of faces in edit mode of the portion you want to turn into a discrete part
	* P > Separate Selection
	* BAM!
	
-----------------------------------------------
--- Part IV: Exporting, Other Programs, Etc ---
-----------------------------------------------

- MAKE SURE IT'S ALL SELECTED: in Blender top right panel ("Scene"), make sure the mouse button is clicked on the Armature and all other parts of the model

- Careful with file types: stl, obj are just meshes / geometry. I.e. no materials.
